# TODO: FreeIPA Exporter — Improvement Roadmap

# 📅 Implementation Plan (Phased):

# 🔹 Phase 1: Logging and Basic Metrics
# ✅ Improve logging with proper levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)
# ✅ Add `ipa_up` metric to indicate FreeIPA API availability
# ✅ Add `scrape_duration_seconds` metric to measure scrape time
# ✅ Handle connection and request timeouts gracefully *(partially handled with fallback if server._conn is None)*

# 🔹 Phase 2: Health Checks and Metric Documentation
# ✅ Implement `/health` endpoint for exporter health monitoring
# ☐ Improve HELP strings and descriptions for Prometheus metrics
# ☐ Add unit tests for core functionality

# 🔹 Phase 3: Replication Status and Error Handling
# ✅ Expose structured replication status (as metrics or labels)
# ✅ Harden response parsing for inconsistent or malformed FreeIPA outputs *(basic try/except present)*
# ☐ Improve resilience to edge cases (missing data, unexpected formats)

# 🔹 Phase 4: Scalability and Performance (Optional)
# ☐ Refactor for async support using `asyncio` or `trio` (optional)
# ☐ Profile and optimize performance-critical paths
# ☐ Add support for parallel requests to different FreeIPA endpoints
